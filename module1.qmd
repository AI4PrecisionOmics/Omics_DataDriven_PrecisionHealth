### Summary 
The field of omic data analysis has been rapidly evolving during the last two decades.
Moreover, the importance of bioinformatics in biomedical research has steadily continued to increase, becoming an almost a required skill for any researcher in the field.
Throughout this module, the students will:

- Obtain a comprehensive overview of the available omics.
- Learn which omic may be more suitable for a given research question.
- Learn how to analyze several types of omics.
:::

## Morning lecture
We will start the lecture with a brief historical review of the omics field.
Commonly used omic technologies, such as genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, will be presented throughtout the lecture.
We will also talk about the present trends of omics technologies and possible future developments.
In particular, we will mention recent advances such as single-cell (2012) and spatial omics (2022) data.

## Afternoon workshop
In this first workshop we will present bioinformatic pipelines for the analysis of some common omics.
We will mainly focus on the initial processing and quality control (downstream analysis will be covered in the following modules).
While some of same principles can found in the analysis of multiple omics, some omics require special software/packages; our aim with this workshop is to teach which tools should be used depending on the omic.
We will provide basic pipelines for the analysis of different omic data, such as whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA-seq and Olink proteomics.

## Lectures and Materials
A markdown tutorial will be uploaded before the workshop.
