We will mainly focus on the initial processing and quality control (downstream analysis will be covered in the following modules). While some of same principles can found in the analysis of multiple omics, some omics require special software/packages; our aim with this workshop is to teach which tools should be used depending on the omic. We will provide basic pipelines for the analysis of different omic data, such as whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA-seq and Olink proteomics."
