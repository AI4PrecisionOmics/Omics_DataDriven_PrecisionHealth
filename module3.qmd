### Summary
A massive number of tools are available for bioinformatic analyses.
In this module we will guide the students across the most important categories of analyses that can be performed.
We will look at classical tools, e.g. linear regression, as well as more recent approaches, e.g. neural networks.
After this module, the students will:
- Have an overview of the different types of analyses that concern omic data.
- Be able to perform these analyses on their data.
:::

## Morning lecture
The lecture will cover a broad spectrum of analyses that can be performed, such as:
- High-dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Clustering: supervised and unsupervised.
- Regression
- Reinforcement machine learning 
- Network analysis
- Generative AI, transfer learning and explainable AI
During this lecture, we will present what goals we can achieve with these tools, together with their limitations.

## Afternoon workshop
During the workshop, we will present the main R/Python packages that can be used to perform the analyses discussed during the lectures.
Examples with code will be provided.

## Seminar
The students will be given a paper on the topic of the module to read, that will be discussed during the seminar.
Active partcipation during the seminar is a requirement to pass.

## Materials
A markdown tutorial will be provided before the tutorial.
