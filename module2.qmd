### Summary
Analyzing paired omics generated from the same biological samples promises to give a more holistic view of the biological processes.
However, there remain several practical questions on how to integrate multi-omics effectively. 
In this module we will present what strategies are currently used by researchers for this purpose.
After this module, the students will:

- Know what are the advantages of multi-omics approaches.
- Be able to implement state-of-the-art analyses for multi-omics integration.
:::

## Morning lecture
In the lecture we will discuss the advantages of multi-omics data; positive examples from the literature will be shown to highlight the potential benefits.
We will present multiple strategies that have been successfully adopted by researchers to integrate multi-omics data.
Pitfalls and open questions regarding multi-omics integration will also be discussed.

## Afternoon workshop
In this workshop we will take a look at available tools for multi-omics integration as well as versatile analysis strategies that can be used for multiple multi-omics.

## Materials
A markdown tutorial will be uploaded before the workshop.
